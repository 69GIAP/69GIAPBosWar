OK, I first wrote these instructions for Stenka, but they should work for 
anyone who wants to use our parser. It is available for anyone who wants 
to us it, or to improve it. 

It is a bit fussy, but simple enough. 

First you will need to set some things up. 

The parser itself is written in PHP, so it needs a PHP-enabled web server. 

If you have access to one, you are good to go. In my case I use my home 
UNIX box, but it doesn't matter where it is just so you have full access to it. 

You will be able to grab the files you need from 
http://phprofparser.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/phprofparser/phprofparser/ 

The important ones are readme (with simple instructions), copy.bat 
(which will be placed on the game server), parse.php (the parser itself) 
and whichever location.csv files you need for your campaign which will be 
placed on the php-enabled web server. 

You will also need to configure your game server to save text log files. 
Instructions can be found in the startup.cfg.settings file. 

Once you have startup.cfg configured and have placed copy.bat in the 
server's data directory you are ready to run a mission and analyze the logs. 

Phase one is to create the mission report from the log text files. 

This consists of a few steps. 

Go to Rise of Flight/data and delete all the log text files that are from 
old missions and the warm-up, etc leaving just the ones from the mission. 
Each mission is time-stamped by the time it was started, then numbered 
from zero to the final log file, generally in the area of 200 or so. Remove 
any files of the format missionReport(.....).txt that are *not* from the 
mission you want to analyze. 

Next click on "copy.bat" in the same directory. This will put all the 
single-digit files into MissionReport1.txt, the two-digit files into 
MissionReport2.txt, and three-digit files into MissionReport3.txt and then 
combine all of these, in order into MissionReport.txt. 

Delete the numbered files (so they won't be included accidentally into the 
next report) and rename MissionReport.txt appropriately... i.e. to something 
like MissionReportYankeeDoodle14.txt. 

Phase two is to analyze the log file. 

Transfer the renamed logfile to the machine where you have installed 
parse.php (I email it to myself). 

parse.php is the parser. It needs to be installed on a machine that has 
a php-enabled web server because it presents the report as a simple web 
page. i.e. you go to http://your.server.com/rof/parse.php to see the report. 
An appropriate locations.csv file also needs to be in that same directory. '
It can be edited as needed to match your campaign (e.g. different borders 
or front-lines). 

You will need to edit the top of parse.php to indicate that this is a 
Yankee Doodle mission by setting the appropriate Campaign variable 
($YANKEEDOODLE) to 1 (and the others to 0), then set $LOGFILE to the name 
of the logfile which you have now placed in the same directory as 
parse.php. Obviously you can configure it for other campaigns also or roll 
your own. See the code for examples. 

Save these changes. 

Then you go to the page and copy-paste the result into a posting in our 
Rise of Flight forum. 

I'll update parse.php from time-to-time with improved internal instructions 
and provisions for new content to make this as fool-proof as possible. 

Best wishes,
