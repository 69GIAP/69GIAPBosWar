Tushka and I have put everything we we've been working on into the GitHub.
First thing to do for you to get the Website up and running in your development environemnt is:

Copy the folder 69GIAPBosWar from the machine that is synchronized to your development computer.

The content of the Website folder goes as is into your htdocs folder of the webserver.

The file 69GIAPBosWar\connect_db.php goes one level above the htdocs folder of the webserver.
(you might need to reconfigure this to be able o use it to connect to your mysql server as the IP I am using
most propably is not alike the one you are using.)

Now the website is already up and running but no SQL interaction is possible so a lot of errors will appear if you try to navigate the pages.

Next step:
boswar_db database

This db is the core db we used during our development.
To sync our work simply create a boswar_db on your mySql server and import all sql files in the Global SQL folder to it.
(Please disregard the subfolder Tushka boswar ....)

Now you already have the core db and you can use the already loaded user
	admin

having the password

	manager

to login to the website.

You can also give it a try and cerate a new user by using the register function.

For additional functionality you need to restore the content of the Example Campaign SQL folder as well.
This adds additional dbs to your mySql server.
These are.
1916
bloody_april
flanders_eagles
skies_of_the_empires

If you set up the connect_db.php file properly and the user you configured in the file has access rights to the imported dbs you should now be ready to start to test all functions on the website.

Goo Luck!
