I have now tried to get boswar installed and running on two different computers.

each time I can get as far as a login screen and no further

There is no document that describes the steps needed to get the system working??

What users and databases must exist at at what point in the database?

What scripts are run in what order?

What are the default users and their passwords at the level of database and in the application?

I have tried hacking my way through, changing passwords by sql and still nothing will work.

I cannot get beyond a login or registration screen to do anything useful.

We will have to address this before we put 10 beta testers stuck in front of a login screen, why not do it now?

I can't do this beacause I can't get it to work.

Thanks in advance.
