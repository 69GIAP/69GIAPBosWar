You may have wondered about the odd capitalization of various variables, 
etc. in the parser.  Here is how it came about.

In the basic parser the rule is that a variable has the same capitalization
as appears in the corresponding log entry.

Where there is no log entry as a guide I used the following rules-of-thumb.
If a variable is a local variable it begins with a lower case letter.
If a variable is a Global Variable it begins with an Upper Case Letter.

Function names are in ALL CAPS.

This is not a style guide to follow.  It was just a way for me to keep track
of the many variables the parser requires.

The db tables that are derived from the parser have column names that match
the corresponding variable names in the parser.  For example $CoalID is a
global variable, so the column name in the rof_coalitions table is CoalID.

I'd prefer that these not be changed.

Changes wouldn't be so bad if we were working under UNIX, because then I could
easily find and replace all examples, but windows makes that very difficult
and hence any such changes would require individually searching through a
large number of function files.

I hope I did not create a mess in your code by changing my coalition variables.

Not at all.  You had just missed one coal_id => coalId change that kept my
stats from working and I fixed it.  However you might note that the name of
the column in the rof_coalitions file is CoalID, while you use coalId.  To 
my UNIX-warped mind, those are not the same.  :)

Yeah, I tend to use camel style variabels starting lower case.
