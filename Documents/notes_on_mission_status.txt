The intended meaning of each mission status is as follows:
1) initialized - the campaign settings have been completed and all allocated
   starting units have been placed at the edges of the map.  This is the stage
   in which the admin sends the two sides their initial group files.  Skip to
   3) planning.

2) moving units - (after previous mission has been analyzed) moving units are
   being placed in their new locations and destroyed units are being removed 
   from the map.  New units (if any) are allocated and admin sends the two
   sides their respective updated group files.

3) planning - the commanders submit group files with their plans and admin 
   merges these.

4) built - planning is complete and admin has built the mission file for the
   next mission.

5) analyzing - mission has been flown and mission log files have been analyzed.
   The admin now adds scoring for any special missions that were completed and
   makes other necessary adjustments to the scores.  Perhaps a preliminary mission
   report is posted in the forums at this stage.

6) scored - log analysis and final scoring are completed and made public.  
   Next step is 2) moving units.
