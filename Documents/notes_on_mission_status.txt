The intended meaning of each mission status is as follows:

1) created - the new campaign database has been created and populated and a user has been
   selected or created to access this campaign.

2) configured - the campaign settings have been completed.  This includes setting scoring
   values for possible targets in rof/bos_object_properties, selecting which airfields will
   be active, selecting which aircraft will be available, and (possibly) selecting which units 
   will be used.

3) initialized - all allocated starting units have been placed at the edges of the map. 
   This is the stage in which the admin sends the two sides their initial group files.  
   Skip to 5) planning because their are no previous moves to worry about. 

4) moving units - (after previous mission has been analyzed) moving units are
   being placed in their new locations and destroyed units are being removed 
   from the map.  New units (if any) are allocated and admin sends the two
   sides their respective updated group files.

5) planning - the commanders submit group files with their plans and admin 
   merges these.

6) built - planning is complete and admin has built the mission file for the
   next mission.

7) analyzing - mission has been flown and mission log files have been analyzed.
   The admin now adds scoring for any special missions that were completed and
   makes other necessary adjustments to the scores.  Perhaps a preliminary mission
   report is posted in the forums at this stage.

8) scored - log analysis and final scoring are completed and made public.  
   Next step is 4) moving units, though logically this also could be done
   immediately after analyzing while final scoring is taking place.
