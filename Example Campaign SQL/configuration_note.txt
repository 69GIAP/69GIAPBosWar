Note that the flanders_eagles database is set up to expect a user "rofwar" 
with a password of "rofwar".  This user should have full permissions on this 
(and perhaps all other rof campaign databases) but no access to boswar_db.

The skies_of_the_empire database uses the same user and password as 
flanders_eagles.

Likewise for 1916.

I will use this same user and password for some future campaign db examples, 
though I reserve the right to try yet another user just to make sure that
that works also.  If I do that, I'll warn you.  :)

If you prefer to use a different user just edit the username and password in
the campaign_settings tables of boswar_db and flanders_eagles to match what 
you have set up.

I have made user #4 a commander (red or blue) in each of these, i.e. this is
probably you.  If not, adjust the campaign's campaign_settings as needed.
