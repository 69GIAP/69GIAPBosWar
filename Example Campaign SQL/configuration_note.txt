Note that the flanders_eagles database is set up to expect a user "rofwar" 
with a password of "rofwar".  This user should have full permissions on this 
(and perhaps all other rof campaign databases) but no access to boswar_db.

The skies_of_the_empire database uses the same user and password as 
flanders_eagles.

Likewise for 1916 and Bloody April.

I will use this same user and password for some future campaign db examples, 
though I reserve the right to try yet another user just to make sure that
that works also.  If I do that, I'll warn you.  :)

If you prefer to use a different user just edit the username and password in
the campaign_settings tables of boswar_db and flanders_eagles to match what 
you have set up.  However, I recommend you use the defined one to save needing
to repeat those changes each time the example db's are updated.

Also note that Skies of the Empires uses custom Coalitions and non-standard 
assignment of countries to coalitions.  So, don't overwrite the rof_countries 
and rof_coalitions files of this campaign if you want stats reported on the 
correct sides.  :)
