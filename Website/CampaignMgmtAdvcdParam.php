                <p>There are numerous parameters about a campaign including: Lineup time, mission time, ground move speeds, vehicle spacing
                diameters for detection of objects, timers etc. An administrator should be able to update these before and during a campaign 
                in order to tune performance. We have set up default values for these and they can be updated by sql in the database. The update screen(s) are not needed for Alpha or Beta test.</p>
