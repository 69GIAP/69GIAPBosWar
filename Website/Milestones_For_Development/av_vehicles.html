<p>For a new campaign we should be able to restrict the vehicles availiable. This screen will list all the availiable vehicles we will then be able to select those that are not availiable, adjust the replacement moving truck for artillery and adjust points values for 
those that are availiable. The update screen is not needed for Alpha or Beta test.</p>
