<p>Control Points and Supply points</p>
<p>We have two types of geographic positions of significance in our campaign map</p>
<p>A control point is a location which is used in the objectives of a campaign. For example the rules may say that
that Central coalition wins if all three Allied control points are captured whereas the Allies win if at lest two
of their control points are not captured at the end of 20 missions. As you can see here the rules do not need to be symetric.
A control point is considered captured if there is one or more enemy vehicles in the Ground Detect Radius and no friendly vehicles.
A control point is contested if there are both friendly and enemy vehicles within the Ground Detect Radius.
We will be able to calculate its status in the campaign statistics but this is not yet implemented.</p>
<p>Normaly control points do not move during a campaign.</p>
<p>A supply point is a point at which resupply vehicles appear on the map. It is normaly near a road or railway and most commonly at
the edge of the campaign sector of a map but we may place a supply point at a rail head deep within the map.
In this case we may move the supply point if bridge damage or lack of trains make it untenable. This is done by the manual
intervention of an administrator.</p>
<p>We use the railway station building (Block rwstation) to represent these points on the map</p>
<p>Current campaign X, Z positions are :</p>

<p>Allied Control Point 1 :X:Z:Angle:Country</p>
<p>Allied Control Point 2 :X:Z:Angle:Country</p>
<p>Allied Control Point 3 :X:Z:Angle:Country</p>
<p>Allied Supply Point 1 :X:Z:Angle:Country</p> 
<p>Allied Supply Point 2 :X:Z:Angle:Country</p> 
<p>Allied Supply Point 3 :X:Z:Angle:Country</p>
<br>
<p>Central Control Point 1 :X:Z:Angle:Country</p>
<p>Central Control Point 2 :X:Z:Angle:Country</p>
<p>Central Control Point 3 :X:Z:Angle:Country</p>
<p>Central Supply Point 1 :X:Z:Angle:Country</p> 
<p>Central Supply Point 2 :X:Z:Angle:Country</p> 
<p>Central Supply Point 3 :X:Z:Angle:Country</p>

<p>You can write them to a group file with supply_point_write.php move them in the mission editor and read them back with
supply_point_read.php. In both cases the file name is supply_point.Group which will be placed in your default campaign directory. Remember you can also change the angle of the building to make it line up neatly beside
a railway or road.</p>
