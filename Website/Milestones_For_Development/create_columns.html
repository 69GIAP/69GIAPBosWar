<p>Create Column</p>
<p>A column is a group of 1-99 vehicles of the same type. 
It must have an unique name by which we can plan its position, 
movement, life and death in the mission planning and statistics.
Do not use special characters and be consistent in the use of capitals.
If in doubt use something sensible like Regiment 1 Platoon 2 or Regiment 1 Zug 1 on the Central side.
Depending on your campaign rules certain columns may have a special function like Engineers repairing
bridges. Your rules should deal with what quantities and types begin the campaign and can be resupplied
in between each mission. Limit the number of columns which are moving during a mission as a moving column
is active throughout the mission. Think about performance when you set quantities. Not only will your 
server performance and line speed set limits but there is a finite limit to the ammount of memeory that the game adresses.
You will have to test to establish your limits.

<p>A column will start from a supply point on the map which will normally be near a road junction at the edge of the map or a railway.</p>

<p>Column name :                                 :</p>
<p>Vehicle :                                 :dropdown list</p>
<p>Qty 1-99:                                 :</p>
<p>Supply Point 1-9 : :</p>
<p>Country :  :dropdown list</p>
<p>During a mission a column may be moving in which case it will be created with the vehicles linked together with a waypoint for its destination.
Some 'vehicles' are artillery and can not move under their own power. These will be loaded into trucks when on the move.
By default a column will try to follow roads where possible. When moving columns try to plan a distance that can be reasonable travelled in the mission time. 
The system will calculate this anyway. Take care to navigate over bridges. If you send 10 trucks across a river, lake or damaged brige they will happily drive into the water and drown.</p> 
<p> When a column is not moving during a mission it will be created with two complex triggers. The first will detect any aircraft
arriving and enable the vehicles so they can be seen and interacted with.
The second will detect any enemy vehicles and will enable the vehicles.
In both cases timers will dis-enable the vehicles. The detection radius and timers can be adjusted in the advanced campaign parameters.
The objective is to keep the minimum number of enabled objects in the mission to maintain performance.</p>
